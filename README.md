# [Recursive-Web](https://riadhadrani.github.io/recursive-website/) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@riadh-adrani/recursive-web?color=blue)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@riadh-adrani/recursive-web)

Web implementation of the Recursive Framework.

-   **Component-Based** : Build encapsulated components, and compose them to make complex UIs. Since everything is implemented with Javascript, you can highly customize your app by adding data and states to your UI.

-   **Declarative** : Recursive make the job simpler by abstracting a lot of ambiguities. Declarative components are predictable and easier to debug.

-   **99.9% Javascript** : If you love Javascript and hate HTML, this is the way ! With Recursive, even style sheets could be written with Javascript!

### Installation

Recursive is still not 100% production-ready, but you can help us test features despite the fact that the library could be drastically changed from version to version.
